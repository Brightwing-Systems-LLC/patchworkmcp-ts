# PatchworkMCP - TypeScript SDK

[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-5.x-blue.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE) [![MCPAmpel](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://mcpampel.com/badge/brightwing-systems-llc/patchworkmcp-ts.json)](https://mcpampel.com/repo/brightwing-systems-llc/patchworkmcp-ts)

PatchworkMCP helps MCP server authors understand how agents actually use their servers — what works, what's missing, and what to build next. This SDK adds three things to your server:

1. **A feedback tool** that agents call when they hit a limitation (missing tool, incomplete data, wrong format). This creates a structured stream of real-world gap reports visible on your PatchworkMCP dashboard.
2. **Server instructions** that tell agents when and how to use the feedback tool. Without these, agents see the tool but don't know when to call it.
3. **A heartbeat monitor** that pings PatchworkMCP every 60 seconds so you can track uptime and see which tools your server exposes.

None of these change your server's existing behavior. They're additive — your existing tools, resources, and prompts stay exactly as they are.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a PatchworkMCP account

Go to [patchworkmcp.com](https://patchworkmcp.com), create a team, register your server, and generate an API key. You'll need:
- Your **API key**
- Your **server slug** (the identifier for your server on PatchworkMCP)

### 2. Install the SDK

```bash
npm install patchworkmcp
# or: yarn add patchworkmcp
```

Zero runtime dependencies — uses the built-in `fetch` API (Node 18+).

### 3. Set environment variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `PATCHWORKMCP_API_KEY` | Your API key from patchworkmcp.com | Yes |
| `PATCHWORKMCP_SERVER_SLUG` | Your server's slug from patchworkmcp.com | Yes |
| `PATCHWORKMCP_URL` | API endpoint (default: `https://patchworkmcp.com`) | No |

### 4. Add to your server

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { registerFeedbackTool, startMiddleware } from "patchworkmcp";

// -- Server instructions --
// This is what tells agents to use the feedback tool. Without it,
// agents may see the tool but won't know when to call it.
const INSTRUCTIONS = `
If you encounter a limitation — a missing tool, incomplete data, wrong format,
or any gap that prevents you from fully completing the user's request — call
the feedback tool BEFORE responding to the user. Be specific about what you
needed and what would have helped.
`;

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  instructions: INSTRUCTIONS,
});

// -- Feedback tool --
// Adds a "feedback" tool that agents call when they hit a gap.
registerFeedbackTool(server);

// -- Heartbeat monitor --
// Sends a ping every 60s with your server slug and tool list.
const mw = startMiddleware({
  toolNames: ["my_tool_1", "my_tool_2"],
});

// To stop later: mw.stop()
```

That's it. Three additions, each one line.

## What Each Piece Does

### Feedback Tool

When an agent can't find the right tool, gets incomplete results, or has to work around a limitation, it calls the `feedback` tool with structured data:

- **what_i_needed** — the capability or data it was looking for
- **what_i_tried** — which tools it tried and what happened
- **gap_type** — category: `missing_tool`, `incomplete_results`, `missing_parameter`, `wrong_format`, `other`
- **suggestion** — the agent's idea for what would help

These reports appear on your PatchworkMCP dashboard, giving you a prioritized list of what to build next based on real agent usage.

### Server Instructions (Critical)

**You must add instructions to your MCP server telling the agent to use the feedback tool.** This is the single most important step in the integration. Without explicit instructions, agents will silently ignore the feedback tool — even though it appears in their tool list.

The `instructions` field on your MCP server is what makes the feedback tool useful. It tells agents: "if you hit a wall, report it before responding." Key principles:

1. **Tell the agent it is required.** Agents treat server instructions as authoritative. If you don't say "you must call the feedback tool," they won't.
2. **Specify when to call it.** List the concrete scenarios: missing tool, incomplete results, wrong format, about to say "not possible."
3. **Say to call it BEFORE responding.** If the agent responds first, it rarely circles back to submit feedback.
4. **Ask for specifics.** Generic feedback like "something was missing" is not actionable.

Without instructions, PatchworkMCP receives zero signal about what your server is missing. **No instructions = no feedback.**

For the full guide on writing effective agent instructions, see [FEEDBACK-TOOL-INSTRUCTIONS.md](FEEDBACK-TOOL-INSTRUCTIONS.md).

### Heartbeat Monitor

The middleware sends a heartbeat to PatchworkMCP every 60 seconds containing:
- Your server slug
- How many tools your server exposes
- The list of tool names

This powers uptime monitoring on your dashboard and lets PatchworkMCP track which tools are live.

## Alternative Integration Patterns

### Manual registration

```typescript
import { TOOL_NAME, TOOL_DESCRIPTION, TOOL_INPUT_SCHEMA, sendFeedback } from "patchworkmcp";

// Register the tool with your framework, then in the handler:
const message = await sendFeedback(args);
```

### Override configuration per-call

```typescript
registerFeedbackTool(server, {
  patchworkUrl: "https://custom.example.com",
  serverSlug: "my-server",
  apiKey: "my-key",
});

const mw = startMiddleware({
  toolNames: ["my_tool_1"],
  apiUrl: "https://custom.example.com",
  serverSlug: "my-server",
  apiKey: "my-key",
});
```

## Reliability

- Feedback submissions retry up to 2 times with exponential backoff (500ms, 1000ms)
- Retries on 429 (rate limit) and 5xx (server error) status codes
- On failure, logs the full payload with `PATCHWORKMCP_UNSENT_FEEDBACK` prefix for later replay
- Never throws — always returns a user-facing message
- Heartbeats are fire-and-forget; failures are logged but don't affect your server
